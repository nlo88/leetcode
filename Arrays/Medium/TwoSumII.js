/*Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, 
find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. 
Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] 
where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers, 
index1 and index2, 
added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. 
You may not use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

Constraints:

2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 104
-1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000
numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order.
-1000 <= target <= 1000
The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution.
